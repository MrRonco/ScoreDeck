# Hardware — Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7 (Rev 1.2)

Identical to the AirRadar unit. Transcribed so ScoreDeck is self-contained.

## Module
ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N16R8: 16 MB QIO flash, 8 MB **OPI** PSRAM. CH343P USB-UART
(macOS needs the WCH CH34x driver cask). An onboard UART slide switch gates
flashing.

## RGB565 panel pins
- Blue  B0–B4: 14, 38, 18, 17, 10
- Green G0–G5: 39, 0, 45, 48, 47, 21
- Red   R0–R4: 1, 2, 42, 41, 40
- DE=5, VSYNC=3, HSYNC=46, PCLK=7
- Timings: hsync 8/4/8, vsync 16/4/16, `pclk_active_neg=1`, `freq_write=14 MHz`

## I2C bus (SDA=8, SCL=9)
- **CH422G expander:** mode reg `0x24` (write `0x01` = push-pull out), output reg
  `0x38`. Bits: b1 TP_RST, b2 DISP/backlight (on/off only — no PWM dimming),
  b3 LCD_RST, b4 SD_CS. Normal value `0x1E`.
- **GT911 touch:** addr `0x5D` (pinned by the reset sequence; `0x14` is the
  alternate), INT = GPIO4, RST on expander b1. LovyanGFX `Touch_GT911`,
  i2c_port 0, 400 kHz.

## GT911 reset sequence
Drive GPIO4 (INT) low as output → TP_RST low (out reg `0x1C`) → 12 ms → TP_RST
high (`0x1E`) → 60 ms (address-latch window, INT held low ⇒ `0x5D`) → release INT
to input → `Wire.end()` so LovyanGFX's I2C driver owns the bus.

## No audio
This board has **no onboard speaker, codec or buzzer**. Only the
ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7C variant carries the ES8389 codec. Score alerts on this unit
are visual only unless a piezo is added to a spare GPIO — and "spare" needs
verifying against the 16 RGB data lines plus DE/VSYNC/HSYNC/PCLK before
soldering.

## Backlight
The CH422G exposes DISP as on/off only. There is no hardware brightness control,
so a "dim at night" feature has to be a software overlay (a scrim, or a darker
theme), not a PWM duty cycle.

## Toolchain
- arduino-esp32 core pinned at **3.3.10**.
- `lv_conf.h` must be copied *beside* the lvgl library folder or the build fails
  with missing symbols.
- On core 3.3.x the FQBN no longer takes `FlashFreq` — `FlashMode=qio` already
  means QIO 80 MHz.
- PSRAM setting must be **OPI PSRAM**.

## Flash layout (planned)
16 MB: 2× ~3.5 MB OTA app slots + ~6 MB FATFS for the logo and roster cache.
